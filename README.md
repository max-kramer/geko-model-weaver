GeKo - An extensible generic weaver for EMF based models

GeKo is an extensible weaver for models that were created using Eclipse's EMF plug-ins. It let's you add, change and remove elements of your EMF model using the syntax that you're already familiar with.

GeKo originated as a set of Eclipse plug-ins at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg. New contributors are welcome!

For the moment you can download a beta release of GeKo, read the wiki article on how to use GeKo or explore the JavaDoc.
